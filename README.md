# Support-Vector-Regression

.

A very basic Support Vector Regression model implemented in python using the sklearn.svm library. Feature scaling has been done to the dataset to get a proper prediction

This implementation is based on Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
Installation

The packages Python, numpy and scikit-learn are required. 

Its a fun coding for learning purpose but those who want to practice with SVR in python then it is very reliable.

In every part i write code by comment who is understanding code is very well.
